# Viberrusingdjango
Basically my first encounter with django. This project was made when learning the basics of Django from Newboston(Bucky Roberts).
The site is responsible for showing the albums as well as artists of the song. It allows the users to bookmark a song as well as upload the music of their choice.
The site has a login and authentication as well using built in django admin panel and certain modifications in the template of django built in panel is also done.
